# MineQuery

## What is MineQuery

Minequery is a JQuery inspired scripting platform for Minecraft, using Javascript. Intended for adventure maps, minigames, and modpacks. This allows creators to easily add an extra dimension to their creations. The main benefit to MineQuery is that it does not require extensive programming experience to use effectively.
